# Fake-news-detection

Description- A king of yellow journalism, fake news is false information and hoaxes spread through social media and other online media to achieve a political agenda. In this data science project idea, we will use Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake. We'll build a TfidfVectorizer and use a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify news into "Real" and "Fake". We'll be using a dataset of shape 7796×4 and execute everything in Jupyter Lab.
